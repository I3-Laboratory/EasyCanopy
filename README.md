# EasyCanopy
This is an implementation of the submitted paper:  
Zhang, W., Peng, X., Bai, T., Wang, H., Takata, D., Guo, W.,(2024), UAV based single lens stereoscopic photography method for phenotyping architecture traits of orchard trees.  
This paper introduces a UAV-based single-lens stereoscopic photography method for orchard tree canopy structure measurement. This procedure can extract 3D canopy structures from UAV aerial images.
